Specs for BnRBot v0.1
----
Storage:
* Two hoppers, one for beans, one for rice.
* Hoppers should be 3d printable. As an option, have the possibility of non-3d printed hoppers. 
* Hoppers should be able to store 50 cups of rice, 50 cups of beans. 
* Hoppers should be able to dispense in 1/4 cup increments. Accuracy +/- 1/8 cup.  
* Hoppers should be air tight, at least on the top, to help prevent spoilage.
* Hoppers should dispense contents via 3d printable auger screw. It is possible there could be spoilage due to air gaps, experimentation will be needed.
* For water, we have two options. 1. Hooks up to water line. Preferable but potentially more difficult. 2. Storage tank, something like a camping jug. 

Cooking:
* Rice cooker and one hot plate/burner. 
* Temperature control
* Should be capable of controlling the temperature automatically.
* Pot and rice cooker will both have lids. We need a way to remove and replace the lids, that doesn't get in the way of removing the pot for easy access to contents.
* Rice cooker does not need stirring. 
* Assuming beans will not need stirring. If they do, we can use magnetic stirrer. 
* Ability to configure the water / dry contents ratio for both beans and rice, allowing for both white and brown rice, etc.
* This might be a better feature for 0.2, but the ability to wash the rice and the ability to soak the beans. Perhaps the dry product can get dispensed into a spouted container first, along with water.

Meal capacity:
* Should be able to prepare rice equal to capacity of rice cooker. 
* Capacity of beans will have to be determined based on what sort of pot is used. 
* When preparing a meal, you specify how many 1/4 cups of dry rice and dry beans you want. Should be trivial for control software to specify servings, and have that convert to 1/4 cups.

Control:
* Whole thing should be controlled via raspberry pi + Arduino. 
* Burner/rice cooker should turn on independently, so that both beans and rice are done at the same time. 
* Control via bash script from workstation or phone. 

Output:
* Process is completed when beans and rice are fully cooked. Determined by software timers. 
* When process is completed, have the option of getting an email, alert, etc. 
* Generates nutrition facts for the total output.
* v0.1 does not scoop beans and rice onto plate, but potentially an option for future versions. 

Cleaning:
* Hoppers will most likely need to be cleaned periodically by hand. 
* Rice cooker and pot will need to be cleaned by hand after each use. 
* Possibility of self cleaning version in the future, as we already have a water line hooked up.
